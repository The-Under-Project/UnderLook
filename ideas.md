# Brice's ideas for the UnderLook project
## Concept:

Since we'd like to stick in the Overwatch/Paladins world, I personally guess that we should keep one of their gamemode.
Overwatch is based on
+ Payload
+ Two control points
+ Hybrid
+ KOTH

I personally think that we should avoid the Hybrid and the KOTH one. Payload should be doable, but we must a team on it from the start of the project.
KOTH could be doable but we would have to design multiple maps. The payload map that could have "capture checkpoints" could be a great idea.
To explain my idea, let's focus on [Numbani](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Numbani). 
Numbani is a hybrid map. You're supposed to capture the first point, then escort the payload until the museum. 
What I'm personally thinking is a payload map with, for example 3 checkpoints.
To capture a checkpoint you would have to make the payload reach the checkpoint, and once you reach the checkpoint, you have to control the checkpoint for 15 seconds on the objective without it being contested.
A game would usually last 10-14 mins.

For the requirements, I think that we shouldn't make a 6 versus 6 game.
3 versus 3 or 4 versus 4 should be more accessible since we only have 6 months and some of us never used Unity yet.
I'm afraid that the project would be too ambitious. 

My personal plan would be to design one map only, a payload/hybrid map.  

For the characters requirements, we could have something between 3 to 8 characters. Once you have created the character class, designing heroes isn't an issue.
We could have, for example:

+ A main tank with a shield. 
+ A main tank with mobility.
+ A burst damage such as a sniper.
+ [A default damage such as 76 in overwatch.](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Soldier:_76)
+ A flanker that can pressure from the side to make space with the main tank.
+ A flanker with really high potential with his ultimate and great mobility.
+ A support that can assist on the damage.
+ A support healing a lot and that can heal the shield.
